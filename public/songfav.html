 <li><h3>Enjoy the silence by Depeche Mode</h3></li>
 <p>A gem of 1980s (?not sure about 80s ngl), the electronic stuff goes hard for seemingly no reason. </p>
 <li><h3>PDA by Interpol</h3></li>
 <p>Ugh, i love this band so much, i am pretty sure that all the songs here can be by Interpol, but this one takes the cake. People often talk about the outro of the song, which is valid because it's gorgeous but i hate it when people downplay the entirety of the song. I love the way the song leads up to the outro.  </p>
 <li><h3>Everything is Romantic by Charli xcx</h3></li>
 <p>Best song off the album Brat. Talk to the wall idc.</p>
 <li><h3>Porcelain by Moby</h3></li>
 <p>I DON'T KNOW WHY I LIKE THIS SONG. I AM SO SERIOUS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WHAT THE FUCK. Pianos are insane. Yet another example of  of electronic music going hard.</p>
 <li><h3>The New by Interpol</h3></li>
 <p>Goes from being sad and desparate to Evil. Best Interpol song imo</p>
 <li><h3>Reptilia by The Strokes</h3></li>
 <p>How dare you talk in between the guitar solo of Reptilia. JAIL. RN.</p>
 <li><h3>NYC by Interpol</h3></li>
 <p>One of the sadder sounding Interpol songs. And the primary song which drew me towards the band (Yes, it was not Obstacle 1). Btw, Subway is a porno.</p>
 <li><h3>Oh My Darling Don't Cry by Run the Jewels </h3></li>
 <p>Slaps fr</p>
 <li><h3>Bnaquet by Bloc Party</h3></li>
 <p>AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. crying. sobbing. throwing up. This is one of the most euphoria enducing songs i have ever heard. One of the best songs. EVER!!!!</p>
 <li><h3>Frontier Psychiatrist by The Avalanches</h3></li>
 <p>I can't describe the sheer absurdity of this song. See it for yourself.</p>
 <li><h3>Last Nite by The strokes</h3></li>
 <p>I love the weird drunk singing on this song, idk why</p>
